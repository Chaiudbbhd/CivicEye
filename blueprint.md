# Project Blueprint

## Overview

This is a Flutter application that provides a variety of features, including:

*   **Authentication:** Users can sign in with Google or email/password.
*   **Image & Text Recognition:** Users can upload images and the app will recognize text in those images.
*   **Location Services:** The app can get the user's current location.
*   **Push Notifications:** The app can receive push notifications from Firebase Cloud Messaging.

## Features Implemented

*   **Google Sign-In:** Users can sign in with their Google account.
*   **Email/Password Sign-In:** Users can sign in with their email and password.
*   **Image Picker:** Users can pick images from their gallery.
*   **Text Recognition:** The app uses Google ML Kit to recognize text in images.
*   **Geolocation:** The app uses the `geolocator` package to get the user's current location.
*   **Firebase Messaging:** The app is configured to receive push notifications from Firebase.

## Current Plan

The current plan is to fix the persistent build issue that is preventing the app from running. The issue is related to the `google_sign_in` package, and all attempts to fix it so far have failed.

## Troubleshooting Log

*   **Initial Error:** The build failed with errors related to the `GoogleSignIn` class, specifically the constructor and the `signIn` method.
*   **Code Correction:** The `lib/services/auth_service.dart` file was updated to use the correct API for `google_sign_in`. The code was verified multiple times.
*   **`flutter clean`:** The `flutter clean` command was run to clear the build cache. The build failed again with the same error.
*   **`rm -rf .dart_tool`:** The `.dart_tool` directory was manually deleted to force a complete re-creation of the package and build cache. `flutter pub get` was run to regenerate the necessary files. The build failed again with the same error.
*   **`flutter pub remove/add`:** The `google_sign_in` package was removed from the `pubspec.yaml` and then added back. This was done to ensure a fresh download of the package. The build failed again with the same error.
*   **`flutter pub upgrade`:** The `flutter pub upgrade` command was run to update all dependencies to their latest compatible versions. No dependencies were changed, as they were already up-to-date. The build failed again with the same error.
*   **File Verification:** The contents of `lib/services/auth_service.dart` were read and verified multiple times to ensure the correct code was present.
*   **`flutter doctor`:** The `flutter doctor` command was run and it revealed that some Android licenses were not accepted.
*   **License Acceptance:** All attempts to accept the Android licenses via the command line have failed.
